```

# Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)


unzip("activity.zip")
dt <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("integer", "Date", "factor"))
dt$month <- as.numeric(format(dt$date, "%m"))
clean_dt <- na.omit(dt)
rownames(clean_dt) <- 1:nrow(clean_dt)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
sum_steps <- aggregate(clean_dt$steps, list(clean_dt$date), FUN = 'sum')
ggplot(sum_steps, aes(x = sum_steps$Group.1)) + geom_histogram(aes(weight=sum_steps$x), bins = 61, col= 'red', fill = 'green', alpha= '0.5')+ scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%Y-%m-%d")) + labs(title="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day") +
         labs(x="Day", y="Total number of steps") 
```

### 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

 * Mean: 

```{r}
mean(sum_steps$x)
```


 - Median:

```{r}
median(sum_steps$x)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
